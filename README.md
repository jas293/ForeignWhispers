# 🌍 Foreign Whispers Project 🌏

## Hey there! 👋
Welcome to *Foreign Whispers*, our adventurous journey into the world of language and technology! We're Jill Shah and Dhruvik Patel, two students fascinated by the power of languages and how they connect us. Our project is all about bringing people closer, no matter the language they speak!

## 🚀 Our Mission
Foreign Whispers is an innovative project that focuses on translating YouTube videos from English into other languages. This project will involve developing a solution to input videos from the [60 minutes channel](https://www.youtube.com/@60minutes), particularly from the [Interviews playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1yx5Z0Lrv77D_g1tvF9u3FVqnrNbCRL), and output them with both spoken and written subtitles in a chosen language.
